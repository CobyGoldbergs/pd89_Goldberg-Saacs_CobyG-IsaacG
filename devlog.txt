5/26/13 Coby submitted the project idea and repo.

5/27/13 Green light on the project idea. Also, Isaac found the Yahoo finance api and JFreeChart.
        Isaac implemented the Yahoo API to retrieve CSV files with wanted data.

5/28/14 Isaac added the base frame to hold the project. Next we must add stuff to the frame container.

5/28/14 Coby updated running median to function for doubles. This will enable us to store data on past stock quotes.
        Coby researched the possibility of pulling historical prices through the yahoo finance api, beyond simple opens and closes for the last day.
        Coby tested the response speed of the yahoo api to various data calls

5/29/14 Isaac worked on proxying while on school server, to make Yahoo finance api work in school.
        Coby continued working with the movement of bid ask prices. He made it work so that higher volatility leads to higher price fluctuations
        and so that a positive or negative market sentiment will lead to likely up or down movements for a stock's price. Next is
        to work with betas and or moving averages. Additionally, a template stock class should be made soon.
        Coby added use of beta and market strength between -1 and 1 (instead of boolean) to the price movement
